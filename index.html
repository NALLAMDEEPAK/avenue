          ABOUT US
      </h2>
      <p>Avenue Family Salon was set up by Mr.Ramana Murthy Athava with the help of his young and disciplined son,Mr.Chaitanya Athava.
           This salon didn't happen in a day or two, but took years of experience and proper planning. Mr.Ramana Murthy Athava had a sales experience of 15 years in various different Organisations.
           And he always had a passion to start something of his own. With the help of his son, he picked up Avenue Family Salon with great dedication and later, his son took the entire responsibility to run the salon when he was pursuing his Engineering 3rd year.
            At such a young age and without any prior experience in this industry, he struggled a lot initially. But he managed to achieve success with the help of his hardworking mother, passionate and professional staff members who always worked 
          for the growth of the salon. He strongly believes that Avenue salon wouldn't have been possible without his father's dedication, friend's and staff members complete guidance and support. His father always treated his staff as his own family and he follows his footsteps.
           Avenue Family Salon is an army of dedicated beauty professionals and known by its 100% result-oriented beauty services.</p>
